<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Started in August 2020 Library Circulation Management System Project grows exponentially through its research in technology. lcmsprojects.com, an initiative by company name works towards development of research based software, embedded/electronics and mechanical systems for research & development purposes. With rapid growth in technology and innovation, Library Circulation Management System Project has now the largest collection of software, mechanical as well as electronics based self learning kits and more systems being researched every month. Due to this we now serve these kits in more than 55 countries across the globe.</p>

<p>Library Circulation Management System Project develops these self learning kits for researchers, students, corporate, institutes and enthusiasts to help in technological research & development. We have developed Library Management System Software that can be used to automate various needs/tasks. Our system has been built to help students all across the world by making them learn easily providing various books. We build these systems to be used as a reverence for further development and studies by engineering students, researchers and enthusiasts.</p>
 

<h3>How it helps Engineers..</h3>
 
<p>Engineers use our kits to upgrade their knowledge on desired software algorithms, electronics concepts & mechanical concepts to enhance their skills open up career options for a better future.</p>

<h3>How it helps Students..</h3>
 
<p>Our Self learning project kits help students learn practical software, electronics and mechanical development by providing all necessary materials needed to make it themselves with informative books and learning documents in one single kit. Our  Library Circulation Management System  provides free project  ideas and innovative concepts to boost student’s  creativity and enthusiasm towards technology.</p>

<h3>How it helps Companies..</h3>
 
<p>Companies researching on particular software algorithms, electronics technologies or mechanical concepts take our books to help in R & D. Also we have books  on  customized R & D services, product research & prototyping as well as free technical consultation to companies.</p>

<h3>How it helps Institutes..</h3>
 
<p>Institutes need our books to practically demonstrate latest electronics concepts, mechanical motions and mechanisms while allowing students to read our  books which enables practical hands on learning experience for students. Also institutes order  our books  to automate & enhance various institute operations.</p>

<h3>How it helps Speakers..</h3>

<p>Our books are loved by speakers to help them conduct practical workshops in schools & colleges all over the globe. Our books and robotic chassis help make workshops more fun and interesting than ever.</p>

<h3>How it helps Enthusiasts & Hobbyists..</h3>
 
<p>There are many enthusiasts and hobbyists out there who wouldn’t be able to practically implement desired software, electronics and electronics systems if it weren’t for our self learning project books. Our various informative books of technology help them bring their dreams to reality.</p>
